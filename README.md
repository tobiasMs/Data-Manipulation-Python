# Data-Manipulation-Python

Use Case Summary
● Objective Statement :
1. Get new insight about the fundamental of data manipulation with Python
2. Get the insight about object series
3. Get the insight about loc and iloc
4. Get the insight about data frame in Python
● Challenges :
1. Python is a case sensitive programming laguage, so the writing of the syntax
must be considered
2. A lot of new things about data manipulation will be learned here, so it needs a
detailed and easy understand explanation
● Expected Outcome :
1. Understand the basics knowledge that needed to manipulate data using python
2. Knowing the difference between implisit and explisit index
3. Knowing the difference between loc and iloc
4. Knowing how to convert data into object series and data frame
● Benefits :
1. As a basic material before manipulating actual data using Python
2. As additional knowledge about object series, loc and iloc, and data frame in
Python
Outlines
● Data Manipulation
1. Manipulation data it's not to change the data value.
2. Data manipulation make the data easier to read by machine.
● Object Series
1. Has one dimension of data.
2. Only has one column.
3. Does not have a column name.
4. Has an index.
5. Can change the data (example: list or tuple type) into object series.
● Loc and Iloc
1. Loc and Iloc are methods in the Pandas library
2. Loc is used to call an explicit index
3. Iloc is used to call an implisit index
● Data Frame
1. A Pandas DataFrame is a 2 dimensional data structure, like a 2 dimensional
array, or a table with rows and columns
2. Data frame is a part of pandas library.
